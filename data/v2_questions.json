The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate.

After this, ovulation will occur (generally around day 14) and this is triggered by the LH surge. This will cause the most mature follicle to be spit out (which is based on how many LH receptors are located on it) and this cell is also known as the secondary oocyte.

The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate.

The histones are responsible for the coiling of DNA around itself to build chromatin. The mitochondria is used to run the ETC and oxidative phosphorylation. The Rough ER has ribosomes which intiate the translation of proteins that are going to be secreted in the lumen. The smooth ER is responsible for lipid synthesis as well as detoxification processes.  The Golgi apparatus is responsible for developing membrane-bound sacs that lead to exocytosis. The peroxisomes are responsible for the breakdown of fatty acid chains with the process of beta-oxidation, generating acetyl-CoA to be used in other metabolic processes.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":false,"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea"},{"image":"","question":"cDNA is generated from reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase","type":"bool","explanation":"cDNA is generated from reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase and corresponds to the sense strand. cDNA generally builds the DNA libraries that exist.","trial":false,"answer":true,"category":"23a1987c-3f61-445a-93eb-ae51f9295c61","subcategory":"8f3ff7c4-c5d5-4ebc-bd4b-5e366016c5c2"},{"image":"","question":"Recall is stronger than recognition.","type":"bool","explanation":"Recognition is a type of information retrieval that requires remembering or \"recognizing\" a particular answer.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

Fluorine is not considered a strong leaving group because of its high electronegativity, making it incredibly stable on its own compared to the others. H2S and RSH are both strong nucleophiles because of the size of the sulfur atoms compared to oxygen (sulfur is a better nucleophile when compared to analagous oxygen compounds).

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":true,"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"P36","question":"In circular dichroism, the alpha secondary structure is around what wavelength?","explanation":"Circular dichroism is a method that is utilized to measure the rotation of light to determine the amount and type of secondary protein structure located within a protein.

The four main ones to be familir with are the freezing point depression, vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

Which of the following monocular cues is he using?","type":"choices","explanation":"There are visual cues in which humans do not require the use of both eyes and only one. These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":"a","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","choices":{"a":"Relative size","b":"Interposition","c":"Relative height","d":"Shading"},"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"","question":"One sleep cycle lasts how long?","type":"choices","explanation":"Sleep cycles tend to last for 90 minutes and go from Stage 2, to stage 3/4 and then REM.

The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

The four main ones to be familir with are the freezing point depression, vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":true,"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea"},{"image":"","question":"Adding a solute will decrease the freezing point depression.","type":"bool","explanation":"The colligative properties on the MCAT are involved in the properties of a molecule where chemical identity does not matter and it only depends on concentration of the solute that is present.

Epinephrine and norepinephrine are the flight-or-fight hormones that are responsible for alertness to the environment as well as involved in the stress response. Dopamine is the pleasure hormone that also has functionalities in controlling smooth movement and decreasing rigidity in the body (deficiency leads to tremors as seen in Parkinson's). Serotonin is involved in the mood and arousal of the body, as well as certain portions of the  REM sleep cycle. GABA and glycine are both inhibitory neurotransmitters that are involved in hyperpolarization of the cell and cause an inhibiton effect within the brain.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). The Third Law is that an action has an equal and opposite reaction (IMPORTANT: this does NOT mean there is an equal effect).","type":"choices","trial":false,"answer":"a","category":"5cbb35e6-3c8f-4f0c-80e9-1750038b636b","subcategory":"fca17820-4599-49d3-a3b7-9ed43cff120b","choices":{"a":"Newton's First Law","b":"Newton's Second Law","c":"Newton's Third Law","d":"None of the above"}},{"image":"","question":"Guanosine has the lowest molecular weight out of the nucleic acids.","explanation":"Guanosine has the largest molecular weight out of the nucleic acids while cytosine has the lowest molecular weight..","type":"bool","trial":false,"answer":false,"category":"c711d753-f826-4009-a30a-05aa8e81d51e","subcategory":"e6eb3863-9931-4b33-b16b-cf992f1c9a4a"},{"image":"","question":"Wernicke’s aphasia is a condition where one does not use proper _____ due to damage on the ____ side of the brain.","explanation":"Wernicke's area is located in the left temporal lobe.

The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered).

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate. Finally, this process occurs in places such as the liver, adrenal cortex (as this is where FA synthesis/steroid synthesis occur), erythrocytes, and lactating mammary glands.","type":"bool","trial":false,"answer":true,"subcategory":"e05639d2-da6a-450c-b6c4-d3188fb53300","category":"c711d753-f826-4009-a30a-05aa8e81d51e"},{"image":"","question":"Benjamin is a 37 year old male that is morbidly obese.

The two groups are the dyssomnias (where the timing of the sleep is affected and the overall amount) and the parasomnias (the disorders in which odd behaviors occur). The dyssomnias include narcolepsy, sleep deprivation, insomnia, and sleep apnea. Narcolepsy is when the individual has an extreme tendency to fall alseep at a moment's notice and is characterized by drowsiness in the daytime. Insomnia is the inability to fall asleep or maintain sleep. Sleep deprivation is where the body is fatigued due to decreased amount of sleep. Sleep apnea is where an individual repeatedly stops and starts breathing and is comorbid with obesity and snoring. The parasomnias include night terrors and somnambulism. Night terrors, which commonly occur in children, are characterized by intense episodes of yelling and intense fear while asleep. This can also be seen in individuals with PTSD.

Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate. Finally, this process occurs in places such as the liver, adrenal cortex (as this is where FA synthesis/steroid synthesis occur), erythrocytes, and lactating mammary glands.","type":"bool","trial":false,"answer":false,"subcategory":"e05639d2-da6a-450c-b6c4-d3188fb53300","category":"c711d753-f826-4009-a30a-05aa8e81d51e"},{"image":"","question":"Which of the following is the measure of the energy change when adding an electron to a valence shell?","type":"choices","explanation":"The ionization energy is the measure of the minimum amount of energy required to remove an outermost electron from an atom and it increase going up and to the right in the periodic table.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate.

NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate.

During exhalation, the volume of the lungs will decrease which will cause the pressure to increase because there are more molecules than before. This is called positive pressure exhalation because it increases to around 763-764 mmHg (compared to 760 mmHg). This pressure will ultimately push molecules out on its own overtime (thus, making exhalation a passive process). The pressure will ultimately decrease back to 760 mmHg.","type":"choices","trial":false,"answer":"b","subcategory":"a7cc7c3a-6d7a-43fc-b878-bb823ef64ebd","choices":{"a":"760 mmHg","b":"755-757 mmHg","c":"763-765 mmHg","d":"None of the above"},"category":"23a1987c-3f61-445a-93eb-ae51f9295c61"},{"image":"","question":"The myeloid progenitors include what?","type":"choices","explanation":"There are two types of progenitors that are developed within the blood marrow for the cells: myeloid and lymphoid.

Succinyl-CoA is then converted to succinate using succinyl-CoA synthease. Succinate is converted to fumarate using succinate dehydrogenase, which is also known as Complex II.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","type":"bool","trial":false,"answer":true,"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea"},{"image":"","question":"Lymphatic ducts drain into lymph nodes.","type":"bool","explanation":"The lymphatic ducts drain into the veins that way they can take the fluid from the tissues to the heart to get more oxygen.","trial":false,"answer":false,"category":"23a1987c-3f61-445a-93eb-ae51f9295c61","subcategory":"929aea39-78eb-4811-b962-5e7155a7c99f"},{"image":"P45","question":"The \"lub\" sound is associated with what set of valves closing?","explanation":"The first sound of the heart (lub) is the sound of the AV valves closing, while the second heart sound (dub) is the sound of the semilunar valves closing.","type":"choices","trial":false,"answer":"a","choices":{"a":"Atrioventricular","b":"Semilunar","c":"Pulmonary","d":"Foramen ovale"},"category":"23a1987c-3f61-445a-93eb-ae51f9295c61","subcategory":"929aea39-78eb-4811-b962-5e7155a7c99f"},{"image":"","question":"A string fixed at both ends, with a length of 3.5 m is struck, which produces a harmonic.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","type":"bool","trial":false,"answer":true,"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea"},{"image":"","question":"In a reaction coordinate diagram, when temperature is higher, thermodynamic energy is","explanation":"In kinetic vs. thermodynamic considerations, it is important to understand what each means.

After this, ovulation will occur (generally around day 14) and this is triggered by the LH surge. This will cause the most mature follicle to be spit out (which is based on how many LH receptors are located on it) and this cell is also known as the secondary oocyte.

The first stage, known as the follicular stage, lasts about the first 13 days and is triggered by the FSH hormone. This causes estrogen to be secreted from the ovaries, which will cause several of the follicles to begin to grow within the ovaries. After this, ovulation will occur (generally around day 14) and this is triggered by the LH surge. This will cause the most mature follicle to be spit out (which is based on how many LH receptors are located on it) and this cell is also known as the secondary oocyte. Finally, during the luteal phase (which lasts from day 15-28), is triggered by LH that works to maintain the corpus luteum by secreting progesterone and estrogen.","trial":false,"answer":"a","subcategory":"7ed7cac7-a06e-4612-b26f-de785a1386fb","choices":{"a":"Follicular","b":"Ovulation","c":"Luteal","d":"None of the above"},"category":"23a1987c-3f61-445a-93eb-ae51f9295c61"},{"image":"","question":"A chair conformation is when a cyclohexane is in its most stable form.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate. Finally, this process occurs in places such as the liver, adrenal cortex (as this is where FA synthesis/steroid synthesis occur), erythrocytes, and lactating mammary glands.","trial":false,"answer":true,"subcategory":"e05639d2-da6a-450c-b6c4-d3188fb53300","category":"c711d753-f826-4009-a30a-05aa8e81d51e"},{"image":"","question":"Smooth muscle is under control by the somatic nervous system","explanation":"Skeletal muscles are under voluntary control and are therefore controlled by the somatic nervous system.

Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered).

These three are the short-term stress hormones that are released by the adrenal medulla to help in situations classified as \"fight or flight\" (like a panic attack). However, we would not expect to see elevated levels of cortisol. This is because cortisol, a steroid hormone synthesized in the adrenal cortex, is a long-term stress hormone that would not be released immediately and would take time to be released and take its full effect.","type":"choices","trial":false,"answer":"a","choices":{"a":"Norepinephrine","b":"Melatonin","c":"TSH","d":"Cortisol"},"subcategory":"f1cf5a1a-545a-4b3f-9774-988f93f53a65","category":"23a1987c-3f61-445a-93eb-ae51f9295c61"},{"image":"","question":"A molecule with 4 bonded pairs and 2 lone pairs has a square planar molecular shape.","type":"bool","explanation":"Electron geometries can be separated into multiple types and are based on the total number of electron pairs, number of lone pairs, and the number of bonding pairs.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","type":"bool","trial":false,"answer":false,"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"","question":"When the Q is greater than the K, the reaction will be at equilibrium.","type":"bool","explanation":"The reaction quotient (Q) is a measure of a reaction at a particular point while the equilibrium constant (K) is a measure of this value at equilibrium.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\".

Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

The conjunctiva is the thin layer of cells that lines the inside of your eyelid. The cornea is the place where light first comes into contact with the eye and it begins to refract or bend the light. The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

After this, ovulation will occur (generally around day 14) and this is triggered by the LH surge. This will cause the most mature follicle to be spit out (which is based on how many LH receptors are located on it) and this cell is also known as the secondary oocyte.

After this, ovulation will occur (generally around day 14) and this is triggered by the LH surge. This will cause the most mature follicle to be spit out (which is based on how many LH receptors are located on it) and this cell is also known as the secondary oocyte. Finally, during the luteal phase (which lasts from day 15-28), is triggered by LH that works to maintain the corpus luteum by secreting progesterone and estrogen.","trial":false,"answer":true,"category":"23a1987c-3f61-445a-93eb-ae51f9295c61","subcategory":"7ed7cac7-a06e-4612-b26f-de785a1386fb"},{"image":"P50","question":"If you add a basic residue the pI increases","type":"bool","explanation":"If you add a basic amino acid residue, the pI is expected to increase, as the overall positive charge has increased within the solution.","trial":false,"answer":true,"subcategory":"910f130f-ef2a-44e8-8d96-31fa97c7bcfa","category":"c711d753-f826-4009-a30a-05aa8e81d51e"},{"image":"P33","question":"Gel filtration separates based on what?","type":"choices","explanation":"Gel filtration chromatography, also known as size exclusion chromatography, separates based on the molecule's apparent size.

Continuity is when we look at lines and trace the simplest path that they could follow. Closure is when we fill the object in or when we have grouped objects together and see the \"whole\" picture. Symmetry is when the mind looks at an object and is able to cut the object in half through a focal point (think of a meso compound).

When there is no light, the pupil will dilate itself to allow the maximum amount of light to enter (if there is any). Down regulation, otherwise known as light adaptation, occurs in response to when it is bright. The pupils will constrict and the rods and cones will desensitize themselves to light.

The conjunctiva is the thin layer of cells that lines the inside of your eyelid. The cornea is the place where light first comes into contact with the eye and it begins to refract or bend the light. The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

The four main ones to be familir with are the freezing point depression, vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

Dopamine is the pleasure hormone that also has functionalities in controlling smooth movement and decreasing rigidity in the body (deficiency leads to tremors as seen in Parkinson's). Serotonin is involved in the mood and arousal of the body, as well as certain portions of the  REM sleep cycle. GABA and glycine are both inhibitory neurotransmitters that are involved in hyperpolarization of the cell and cause an inhibiton effect within the brain.

Which of the following describes this?","type":"choices","explanation":"There are visual cues in which humans do not require the use of both eyes and only one. These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":"d","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","choices":{"a":"Relative size","b":"Interposition","c":"Relative height","d":"Shading"},"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea"},{"image":"","question":"The rods are primarily used to detect light.","type":"bool","explanation":"Cones are mainly involved in the processing of color and are used for detecting high levels of detail in the objects.

The histones are responsible for the coiling of DNA around itself to build chromatin. The mitochondria is used to run the ETC and oxidative phosphorylation. The Rough ER has ribosomes which intiate the translation of proteins that are going to be secreted in the lumen. The smooth ER is responsible for lipid synthesis as well as detoxification processes.  The Golgi apparatus is responsible for developing membrane-bound sacs that lead to exocytosis. The peroxisomes are responsible for the breakdown of fatty acid chains with the process of beta-oxidation, generating acetyl-CoA to be used in other metabolic processes. The cytoskeleton is responsible for providing the structure for the cell and helps it to maintain its overall shape (composed of microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments).

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

Fluorine is not considered a strong leaving group because of its high electronegativity, making it incredibly stable on its own compared to the others. H2S and RSH are both strong nucleophiles because of the size of the sulfur atoms compared to oxygen (sulfur is a better nucleophile when compared to analagous oxygen compounds). SN1 reactions are favored by weaker nucleophiles, polar protic solvents, and tertiary substrates. Examples of weak nucleophiles are F- (as discussed previously), H2O (no negative charge, stable on its own), and ROH (similar to H2O).","answer":"c","subcategory":"c1e401a6-3592-4674-bf04-301b242e837e","category":"b25477b7-5bd9-42b9-98f3-3c3bf4b4f494","choices":{"a":"HO-","b":"RO-","c":"ROH","d":"RSH"}},{"image":"P216","question":"Vitamin K is fat soluble.","explanation":"Vitamins A, D, E, and K are considered the fat-soluble vitamins.

The conjunctiva is the thin layer of cells that lines the inside of your eyelid. The cornea is the place where light first comes into contact with the eye and it begins to refract or bend the light. The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":false,"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea"},{"image":"P149","question":"___ sugars have hemi acetal and ketal configurations at anomeric carbon","type":"choices","explanation":"Reducing sugars have hemiacetal or hemiketal configurations at the anomeric carbon while non-reducing sugars have acetal or ketal configurations at the anomeric carbon.","trial":false,"answer":"a","category":"c711d753-f826-4009-a30a-05aa8e81d51e","choices":{"a":"Reducing","b":"Non-reducing","c":"Hydrolyazble","d":"Prostaglandins"},"subcategory":"7161509a-0b62-413b-b4b0-f11504d457df"},{"image":"P236","question":"Consisting of theta wave activity is which of the following?","explanation":"Stage 1 of sleep has theta waves, stage 2 has theta waves, stage 3/4 has delta waves, and REM sleep displays beta waves.","type":"choices","trial":false,"answer":"a","subcategory":"97b6f416-b390-4f5a-aa73-3c4b236a500d","choices":{"a":"Stage 1","b":"Stage 5","c":"Stage 3/4","d":"REM sleep"},"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"","question":"The electric force depends on the strength of the electric field","type":"bool","explanation":"Force is directly related to the amount of charge in the field.

The four main ones to be familir with are the freezing point depression, vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values. When you take away solute, the boiling point elevation and osmotic pressure will both decrease. Finally, you have to be familiar with their equations. The equation for freezing point depression is -Kfim (where Kf is a constant for each molecule, i is the Van't Hoff factor, and m is the molality). The equation for boiling point elevation is Kbim (where Kb is the constant for boiling point elevation, i is the Van't Hoff factor, and m is the molality). Finally, the equation for osmotic pressure is iMRT (where i is the Van't Hoff factor, M is the molarity, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin).","trial":false,"answer":false,"subcategory":"85fa4677-9f23-429e-9ace-2e50145e9da3","category":"baf6c412-c8b3-4bc2-b461-7b7920d4eb89"},{"image":"","question":"Propyl has five carbons associated with it.","explanation":"When naming alkane chains in organic chemistry, it is important to know how many carbons relate to the prefix of the name.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":"d","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","choices":{"a":"Motion parallax","b":"Size Constancy","c":"Shape Constancy","d":"All of the above"},"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea"},{"image":"","question":"Andy does not hear a signal despite the fact that there was a signal present.

Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\".

What is this called?","type":"choices","explanation":"There are visual cues in which humans do not require the use of both eyes and only one. These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":"b","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","choices":{"a":"Relative size","b":"Interposition","c":"Relative height","d":"Shading"},"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"","question":"Stage 2 of sleep has theta waves","explanation":"Stage 1 of sleep has theta waves, stage 2 has theta waves, stage 3/4 has delta waves, and REM sleep displays beta waves.","type":"bool","trial":false,"answer":true,"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"97b6f416-b390-4f5a-aa73-3c4b236a500d"},{"image":"P46","question":"Where does a lysosomal protein get translated?","type":"choices","explanation":"There are four types of protein destinations: cytosolic, lysosomal, secreted, and transmembrane.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate. Finally, this process occurs in places such as the liver, adrenal cortex (as this is where FA synthesis/steroid synthesis occur), erythrocytes, and lactating mammary glands.","trial":false,"answer":true,"subcategory":"e05639d2-da6a-450c-b6c4-d3188fb53300","category":"c711d753-f826-4009-a30a-05aa8e81d51e"},{"image":"","question":"Pentose phosphate pathway occurs in the mitochondria","type":"bool","explanation":"The PPP is used to generate NADPH and anti-oxidants.

When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered).

Air molecules will eventually move back into the lungs, causing the pressure to increase to about 760. During exhalation, the volume of the lungs will decrease which will cause the pressure to increase because there are more molecules than before. This is called positive pressure exhalation because it increases to around 763-764 mmHg (compared to 760 mmHg). This pressure will ultimately push molecules out on its own overtime (thus, making exhalation a passive process). The pressure will ultimately decrease back to 760 mmHg.

Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate.

Dopamine is the pleasure hormone that also has functionalities in controlling smooth movement and decreasing rigidity in the body (deficiency leads to tremors as seen in Parkinson's). Serotonin is involved in the mood and arousal of the body, as well as certain portions of the  REM sleep cycle.

Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

Continuity is when we look at lines and trace the simplest path that they could follow. Closure is when we fill the object in or when we have grouped objects together and see the \"whole\" picture. Symmetry is when the mind looks at an object and is able to cut the object in half through a focal point (think of a meso compound).

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

Higher ratings on one scale that is based on attractiveness would indeed be influenced by this and negative trait-based scales would be unlikely to show anything negative about that person. Essentially, our positive outlook on someone increases due to this effect. Fundamental attribution error is attributing dispositional attributions to someone even though it might be situational in nature (someone showing up late for work but in reality it is just because they hit a traffic jam but you assume it's because they are lazy). Confirmation bias is the act of searching out information that looks to prove only your side (using biased sources, generally seen in the political realm). The availability heuristic is only taking information that is available \"at the ready\", such as hearing about a plane crashing and applying that to all flights (even though motor vehicles kills more people every year). In this particular case, it can't be deduced that this is racism or discrimination, as Fred did not take any action and only held a belief (perhaps it could be considered prejudice, but it is also important to note that Fred did not believe this because of her race and just because this is her first impression with him).","type":"bool","trial":false,"answer":true,"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"704d48c7-355a-4672-bec5-9d6e0919e239"},{"image":"","question":"How many of the following molecules has a non-zero dipole moment?

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate. Finally, this process occurs in places such as the liver, adrenal cortex (as this is where FA synthesis/steroid synthesis occur), erythrocytes, and lactating mammary glands.","trial":false,"answer":false,"subcategory":"e05639d2-da6a-450c-b6c4-d3188fb53300","category":"c711d753-f826-4009-a30a-05aa8e81d51e"},{"image":"","question":"Which of the following gives your eye color?","explanation":"There are many parts of the eye that you have to be familiar with for the MCAT. The conjunctiva is the thin layer of cells that lines the inside of your eyelid. The cornea is the place where light first comes into contact with the eye and it begins to refract or bend the light. The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.","type":"choices","trial":false,"answer":"a","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","choices":{"a":"Iris","b":"Cornea","c":"Lens","d":"Retina"},"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"","question":"A peptide chain has the sequence ARTDIGS which of the following amino acid can be substituted for Aspartic Acid with the least change in function?","explanation":"An amino acid that would have to be replaced with have to result in a conservative mutation or one that does not change the overall function of the protein as much.

The histones are responsible for the coiling of DNA around itself to build chromatin. The mitochondria is used to run the ETC and oxidative phosphorylation. The Rough ER has ribosomes which intiate the translation of proteins that are going to be secreted in the lumen. The smooth ER is responsible for lipid synthesis as well as detoxification processes.  The Golgi apparatus is responsible for developing membrane-bound sacs that lead to exocytosis. The peroxisomes are responsible for the breakdown of fatty acid chains with the process of beta-oxidation, generating acetyl-CoA to be used in other metabolic processes. The cytoskeleton is responsible for providing the structure for the cell and helps it to maintain its overall shape (composed of microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments).

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":true,"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"P150","question":"Which of the following is a disaccharide made of glucose and glucose combined with alpha linkages?","type":"choices","explanation":"Sucrose is the most common non-reducing sugar and it is made with glucose and fructose linkages in the alpha configuration.

Insomnia is the inability to fall asleep or maintain sleep. Sleep deprivation is where the body is fatigued due to decreased amount of sleep. Sleep apnea is where an individual repeatedly stops and starts breathing and is comorbid with obesity and snoring. The parasomnias include night terrors and somnambulism. Night terrors, which commonly occur in children, are characterized by intense episodes of yelling and intense fear while asleep. This can also be seen in individuals with PTSD.

One way to choose a pathway is be selecting the nucleophile to favor a particular way. SN2 reactions are favored by strong nucleophiles, polar aprotic solvents, and methyl or primary substrates. Examples of strong nucleophiles are: the halogens (I-, Br-, and Cl-) excluding F-, HO-, HS-, H2S, RO-, RSH, and nitriles. The odd ones of these listed are fluorine (as it is a halogen) and RSH/H2S (no negative charge). Fluorine is not considered a strong leaving group because of its high electronegativity, making it incredibly stable on its own compared to the others. H2S and RSH are both strong nucleophiles because of the size of the sulfur atoms compared to oxygen (sulfur is a better nucleophile when compared to analagous oxygen compounds). SN1 reactions are favored by weaker nucleophiles, polar protic solvents, and tertiary substrates.

This is called negative pressure breathing (as the pressure decreases to 757 mmHg rather than 760 mmHg). Air molecules will eventually move back into the lungs, causing the pressure to increase to about 760. During exhalation, the volume of the lungs will decrease which will cause the pressure to increase because there are more molecules than before.

The four main ones to be familir with are the freezing point depression, vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

The conjunctiva is the thin layer of cells that lines the inside of your eyelid. The cornea is the place where light first comes into contact with the eye and it begins to refract or bend the light. The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered).

The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate.

The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases).

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered).

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate.

The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\".

Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity. The Third Law is that an action has an equal and opposite reaction (IMPORTANT: this does NOT mean there is an equal effect).","type":"bool","trial":false,"answer":true,"category":"5cbb35e6-3c8f-4f0c-80e9-1750038b636b","subcategory":"fca17820-4599-49d3-a3b7-9ed43cff120b"},{"image":"P3","question":"Which of the following is responsible for relaxing the supercoiling in DNA?","type":"choices","explanation":"There are many enzymes that are necessary for DNA replication to occur.

This is called negative pressure breathing (as the pressure decreases to 757 mmHg rather than 760 mmHg). Air molecules will eventually move back into the lungs, causing the pressure to increase to about 760. During exhalation, the volume of the lungs will decrease which will cause the pressure to increase because there are more molecules than before. This is called positive pressure exhalation because it increases to around 763-764 mmHg (compared to 760 mmHg).

After this, ovulation will occur (generally around day 14) and this is triggered by the LH surge. This will cause the most mature follicle to be spit out (which is based on how many LH receptors are located on it) and this cell is also known as the secondary oocyte.

Furthermore, the kinetic friction opposes the direction of velocity and is used in problems that generally involve words such as \"slipping and/or skidding\".  The static friction has no motion relative to the object, so this is involved in problems such as \"rolling without slipping\" and the direction opposes the other forces.

The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

The four main ones to be familir with are the freezing point depression, vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

What describes this phenomenon?","explanation":"There are visual cues in which humans do not require the use of both eyes and only one. These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","type":"choices","trial":false,"answer":"c","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","choices":{"a":"Relative size","b":"Size Constancy","c":"Shape Constancy","d":"Color Constancy"},"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"P131","question":"Plasma cells are part of the T lymphocytes.","type":"bool","explanation":"The two types of immune systems are the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases).

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":false,"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea"},{"image":"","question":"Guanine can replace adenine in ATP and perform functions.","explanation":"Thymine is unable to replace adenine as a base in ATP.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

The histones are responsible for the coiling of DNA around itself to build chromatin. The mitochondria is used to run the ETC and oxidative phosphorylation. The Rough ER has ribosomes which intiate the translation of proteins that are going to be secreted in the lumen. The smooth ER is responsible for lipid synthesis as well as detoxification processes.  The Golgi apparatus is responsible for developing membrane-bound sacs that lead to exocytosis. The peroxisomes are responsible for the breakdown of fatty acid chains with the process of beta-oxidation, generating acetyl-CoA to be used in other metabolic processes. The cytoskeleton is responsible for providing the structure for the cell and helps it to maintain its overall shape (composed of microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments).

What will increase?","explanation":"The colligative properties on the MCAT are involved in the properties of a molecule where chemical identity does not matter and it only depends on concentration of the solute that is present. The four main ones to be familir with are the freezing point depression, vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values. When you take away solute, the boiling point elevation and osmotic pressure will both decrease.","type":"choices","trial":false,"answer":"a","category":"baf6c412-c8b3-4bc2-b461-7b7920d4eb89","subcategory":"85fa4677-9f23-429e-9ace-2e50145e9da3","choices":{"a":"Boiling point elevation","b":"Vapor pressure","c":"Freezing point depression","d":"All of the above"}},{"image":"P42","question":"Which of the following hormones are not released by the anterior pituitary gland?","type":"choices","explanation":"The posterior pituitary gland is responsible for releasing oxytocin and ADH.

Continuity is when we look at lines and trace the simplest path that they could follow. Closure is when we fill the object in or when we have grouped objects together and see the \"whole\" picture. Symmetry is when the mind looks at an object and is able to cut the object in half through a focal point (think of a meso compound). The Law of Common Fate is when there is a distinct movement (think of a flock of geese shaped like a V) and we are able to look at the pathway that they are taking.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":true,"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea"},{"image":"","question":"The most mature follicle will be spit out during the ovulation phase.","type":"bool","explanation":"The ovarian cycle can be broken into three stages.

This causes estrogen to be secreted from the ovaries, which will cause several of the follicles to begin to grow within the ovaries. After this, ovulation will occur (generally around day 14) and this is triggered by the LH surge. This will cause the most mature follicle to be spit out (which is based on how many LH receptors are located on it) and this cell is also known as the secondary oocyte.

The four main ones to be familir with are the freezing point depression, vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values. When you take away solute, the boiling point elevation and osmotic pressure will both decrease. Finally, you have to be familiar with their equations. The equation for freezing point depression is -Kfim (where Kf is a constant for each molecule, i is the Van't Hoff factor, and m is the molality). The equation for boiling point elevation is Kbim (where Kb is the constant for boiling point elevation, i is the Van't Hoff factor, and m is the molality).

Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero).

Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values. When you take away solute, the boiling point elevation and osmotic pressure will both decrease. Finally, you have to be familiar with their equations. The equation for freezing point depression is -Kfim (where Kf is a constant for each molecule, i is the Van't Hoff factor, and m is the molality). The equation for boiling point elevation is Kbim (where Kb is the constant for boiling point elevation, i is the Van't Hoff factor, and m is the molality). Finally, the equation for osmotic pressure is iMRT (where i is the Van't Hoff factor, M is the molarity, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin).","type":"choices","trial":false,"answer":"a","subcategory":"85fa4677-9f23-429e-9ace-2e50145e9da3","category":"baf6c412-c8b3-4bc2-b461-7b7920d4eb89","choices":{"a":"-Kfim","b":"Kbim","c":"IMRT","d":"None of the above"}},{"image":"","question":"Repression is a voluntary process.","type":"bool","explanation":"Suppression is a defense mechanism in which you forcefully suppress thoughts or behaviors back from the conscious.

Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

The dyssomnias include narcolepsy, sleep deprivation, insomnia, and sleep apnea. Narcolepsy is when the individual has an extreme tendency to fall alseep at a moment's notice and is characterized by drowsiness in the daytime. Insomnia is the inability to fall asleep or maintain sleep. Sleep deprivation is where the body is fatigued due to decreased amount of sleep. Sleep apnea is where an individual repeatedly stops and starts breathing and is comorbid with obesity and snoring. The parasomnias include night terrors and somnambulism. Night terrors, which commonly occur in children, are characterized by intense episodes of yelling and intense fear while asleep. This can also be seen in individuals with PTSD.

The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.","trial":false,"answer":"a","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","choices":{"a":"Conjunctiva","b":"Cornea","c":"Anterior chamber","d":"Pupil"},"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"","question":"The y value for a first order is 1/[X]","type":"bool","explanation":"Zeroth order reactions, in order to yield a slope of k, must have their y value correspond to [X].

The four main ones to be familir with are the freezing point depression, vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values. When you take away solute, the boiling point elevation and osmotic pressure will both decrease. Finally, you have to be familiar with their equations. The equation for freezing point depression is -Kfim (where Kf is a constant for each molecule, i is the Van't Hoff factor, and m is the molality). The equation for boiling point elevation is Kbim (where Kb is the constant for boiling point elevation, i is the Van't Hoff factor, and m is the molality).

The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate. Finally, this process occurs in places such as the liver, adrenal cortex (as this is where FA synthesis/steroid synthesis occur), erythrocytes, and lactating mammary glands.","type":"bool","trial":false,"answer":false,"category":"c711d753-f826-4009-a30a-05aa8e81d51e","subcategory":"e05639d2-da6a-450c-b6c4-d3188fb53300"},{"image":"","question":"An S configuration corresponds to a D sugar.","type":"bool","explanation":"An R configuration will correspond to a D sugar, while an S configuration will correspond to an L sugar.","trial":false,"answer":false,"subcategory":"7161509a-0b62-413b-b4b0-f11504d457df","category":"c711d753-f826-4009-a30a-05aa8e81d51e"},{"image":"","question":"PET is used for structure and function","type":"bool","explanation":"A PET scan is used for both structure and function.

The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

Dopamine is the pleasure hormone that also has functionalities in controlling smooth movement and decreasing rigidity in the body (deficiency leads to tremors as seen in Parkinson's). Serotonin is involved in the mood and arousal of the body, as well as certain portions of the  REM sleep cycle. GABA and glycine are both inhibitory neurotransmitters that are involved in hyperpolarization of the cell and cause an inhibiton effect within the brain. Glutamate is the brain's main excitatory neurotransmitter and is involved in learning and retention processes.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","type":"bool","question_pdfs":null,"trial":"true","answer":false,"question_videos":null,"question_image":null,"id":"8a20b0f0-0ea5-4b41-a782-392745fa6b15","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","question_images":null},{"image":"","question":"Protease is part of which enzyme family?","type":"choices","explanation":"Oxidoreductases are a class of enzyme that use redox reaction and electron transfers.

This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero).

NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate. Finally, this process occurs in places such as the liver, adrenal cortex (as this is where FA synthesis/steroid synthesis occur), erythrocytes, and lactating mammary glands.","type":"bool","trial":false,"answer":true,"category":"c711d753-f826-4009-a30a-05aa8e81d51e","subcategory":"e05639d2-da6a-450c-b6c4-d3188fb53300"},{"image":"","question":"The forming of bonds is an exothermic process.","explanation":"When bonds are being broken, there is the addition of energy to them, which is indicative of an endothermic reaction occurring.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

The four main ones to be familir with are the freezing point depression, vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase.

The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity. The Third Law is that an action has an equal and opposite reaction (IMPORTANT: this does NOT mean there is an equal effect).","trial":false,"answer":"b","subcategory":"fca17820-4599-49d3-a3b7-9ed43cff120b","category":"5cbb35e6-3c8f-4f0c-80e9-1750038b636b","choices":{"a":"Positive","b":"Constant","c":"Negative","d":"None of the above"}},{"image":"","question":"The anterior chamber is filled with vitreous humor.","type":"bool","explanation":"There are many parts of the eye that you have to be familiar with for the MCAT.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate.

This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero).

This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero).

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":false,"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"","question":"Andrew is undergoing a hearing test.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":true,"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea"},{"image":"","question":"There are many different reactions in organic chemistry that you need to know.

It is favored by polar protic solvents (such as water or ethanol), its reaction rate is only dependent upon the leaving group/substrate, it yields a racemic mixture (enantiomers of one another) and a strong nucleophile is not required. the SN2 reaction has the same outcome: the nucleophile replaces the leaving group on the substrate. However, the main difference is that this occurs in a concerted mechanism, or in one step.SN2 reactions favor methyl substrates, favor polar aprotic solvents, are optically active (resulting in an inversion of configuration), and are favored with a stronger nucleophile (something with a negative charge).","type":"choices","answer":"d","subcategory":"c1e401a6-3592-4674-bf04-301b242e837e","category":"b25477b7-5bd9-42b9-98f3-3c3bf4b4f494","choices":{"a":"Methyl","b":"Primary carbons","c":"Secondary carbons","d":"Tertiary carbons"}},{"question":"The lining of the lungs belongs to the mesoderm germ layer.","type":"bool","explanation":"The lining of the lungs belongs to the endoderm layer along with the thyroid, parathyroid, liver, pancreas, digestive tract, and urinary bladder.\n","question_pdfs":[],"trial":false,"answer":false,"question_videos":[],"subcategory":"a7cc7c3a-6d7a-43fc-b878-bb823ef64ebd","category":"23a1987c-3f61-445a-93eb-ae51f9295c61","question_images":[]},{"question":"The liver belongs to the mesoderm germ layer.","type":"bool","explanation":"The liver belongs to the endoderm layer along with the thyroid, parathyroid, urinary bladder, pancreas, digestive tract, and the lining of the lungs.\n","question_pdfs":[],"trial":false,"answer":false,"question_videos":[],"category":"23a1987c-3f61-445a-93eb-ae51f9295c61","subcategory":"19658ff0-61d2-44d2-8d67-87caab12b999","question_images":[]},{"question":"Test","type":"bool","explanation":"","question_pdfs":[{"url":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/kings-of-the-curve-sonal.appspot.com/o/pdfs%2Fma1qlqxtcpdf?alt=media&token=5459424c-08ca-4138-98d3-644f8c1ba6a9"}],"trial":false,"answer":true,"question_videos":[{"url":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/kings-of-the-curve-sonal.appspot.com/o/videos%2F2vasrv95vmp4?alt=media&token=4a3bbe31-314a-42dc-93eb-4de1ee8f38f0"}],"id":"DFRQeNIOYItPSrLYoFAn","category":"23a1987c-3f61-445a-93eb-ae51f9295c61","subcategory":"01bc7d98-ee7b-4365-b537-97b010b5cfab","question_images":[{"image_url":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/kings-of-the-curve-sonal.appspot.com/o/images%2F3u1kp1zwvpng?alt=media&token=c1dde6b1-710a-4ef1-a14e-ddff13c9367e"},{"image_url":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/kings-of-the-curve-sonal.appspot.com/o/images%2Fevn6cmnq8png?alt=media&token=73457f51-075c-410e-a52f-6f2bd0494728"}]},{"question":"Which characteristic is associated with the formal operational stage of cognitive development?","type":"choices","explanation":"The formal operational stage of cognitive development is characterized by traits such as abstract logic and reasoning, theoretical thinking, and strategy.","question_pdfs":[],"trial":false,"answer":"Abstract logic and reasoning","question_videos":[],"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","choices":{"a":"Object permanence","b":"Understanding conservation of quantity","c":"Abstract logic and reasoning","d":"Symbolic thinking"},"subcategory":"92168bd5-fa49-4420-ae38-71a5b72c0b18","question_images":[]},{"question":"HCl is a...","type":"choices","explanation":"HCl is a strong acid.","question_pdfs":[],"trial":false,"answer":"Strong acid","question_videos":[],"subcategory":"56fcd52b-7eeb-4369-b20c-6550d9172237","category":"baf6c412-c8b3-4bc2-b461-7b7920d4eb89","choices":{"a":"Weak acid","b":"Strong acid","c":"Weak base","d":"Strong base"},"question_images":[]},{"question":"The thyroid belongs to the endoderm layer.","explanation":"The thyroid belongs to the endoderm layer along with the urinary bladder, parathyroid, liver, pancreas, digestive tract, and the lining of the lungs.","type":"bool","question_pdfs":[],"trial":false,"answer":true,"question_videos":[],"subcategory":"18d774f0-2172-4560-9122-6ce20225adc1","category":"23a1987c-3f61-445a-93eb-ae51f9295c61","question_images":[]},{"question":"HBr is a...","type":"choices","explanation":"HBr is a strong acid.","question_pdfs":[],"trial":false,"answer":"Strong acid","question_videos":[],"category":"baf6c412-c8b3-4bc2-b461-7b7920d4eb89","subcategory":"3793a0d0-0412-4d74-90fb-a9a1459a7c47","choices":{"a":"Weak acid","b":"Strong acid","c":"Weak base","d":"Strong base"},"question_images":[]},{"question":"The central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems belong to the endoderm germ layer.","explanation":"The central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems belong to the ectoderm germ layer along with nails, epidermis, pituitary gland, eye lens, and tooth enamel. \n","type":"bool","question_pdfs":[],"trial":false,"answer":false,"question_videos":[],"subcategory":"2f716c98-b1de-4aea-9771-e9fe044a92c1","category":"23a1987c-3f61-445a-93eb-ae51f9295c61","question_images":[]},{"question":"The preoperational stage of cognitive development exists at what stage of development?","type":"choices","explanation":"The preoperational stage of cognitive development exists within the age range of 2-7 years of age.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":"c","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","choices":{"a":"Relative size","b":"Constancy","c":"Motion parallax","d":"Shading"}},{"image":"","question":"Natalie is synthesizing compounds and finds that they are not mirror images of one another.

NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered).

Resonance relates to the delocalization of charge, with the more delocalization occuring the more stable our overall molecule will be. Induction relates to electron withdrawing atoms working to take away excess electron density from our charged species, making it more stable.

The conjunctiva is the thin layer of cells that lines the inside of your eyelid. The cornea is the place where light first comes into contact with the eye and it begins to refract or bend the light. The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate. Finally, this process occurs in places such as the liver, adrenal cortex (as this is where FA synthesis/steroid synthesis occur), erythrocytes, and lactating mammary glands.","trial":false,"answer":true,"subcategory":"e05639d2-da6a-450c-b6c4-d3188fb53300","category":"c711d753-f826-4009-a30a-05aa8e81d51e"},{"image":"","question":"Which of the following has no change during contraction?","type":"choices","explanation":"During contraction, there are different parts of the sarcomere that you have to be familiar with.

The main portion of the eye that controls this is the pupil. When there is a big influx of light, the pupil will constrict itself to not allow as much to hit the retina. When there is no light, the pupil will dilate itself to allow the maximum amount of light to enter (if there is any). Down regulation, otherwise known as light adaptation, occurs in response to when it is bright. The pupils will constrict and the rods and cones will desensitize themselves to light. Up regulation, also known as dark regulation, occurs in response to little or no light. The rods and cones will begin to synthesize light-sensitive molecules and the pupil will dilate itself to allow for the maximum amount of light to enter.","type":"choices","trial":false,"answer":"c","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","choices":{"a":"Cones","b":"Sclera","c":"Pupil","d":"Lens"},"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea"},{"image":"P286","question":"Hair cells are what type of receptors?","type":"choices","explanation":"","trial":false,"answer":"a","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","choices":{"a":"Mechanorecepetors","b":"Thermoreceptors","c":"Proprioreceptors","d":"Kinetic receptors"}},{"image":"","question":"Which of the following is LEAST likely to be a factor in observational learning?","explanation":"","type":"choices","trial":false,"answer":"a","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"92168bd5-fa49-4420-ae38-71a5b72c0b18","choices":{"a":"Developmental stage of observer","b":"Consequence of model","c":"Emotional state of model","d":"Consequence of observer"}},{"image":"","question":"Ubiquinone uses NADH to convrt to ubiquinol","type":"bool","explanation":"Ubiquinone uses FADH2 produced by succinate dehydrogenase to convert it into ubiquinol.","trial":false,"answer":false,"subcategory":"e05639d2-da6a-450c-b6c4-d3188fb53300","category":"c711d753-f826-4009-a30a-05aa8e81d51e"},{"image":"","question":"The paratope is the antibody-binding site.","explanation":"The epitope is the location at which the antibody will bind to the protein/antigen whereas the paratope is the location where the antigen will bind to.","type":"bool","trial":false,"answer":false,"subcategory":"9e4562a1-20fd-40b1-8a3a-3c6c5055c429","category":"23a1987c-3f61-445a-93eb-ae51f9295c61"},{"image":"","question":"Fatty acid oxidation occurs in the mitochondria.","explanation":"Fatty acid oxidation occurs in the mitochondria in most eukaryotic cells.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\".

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate.

The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":false,"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"P53","question":"Which of the following is used to convert 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate?","explanation":"Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate in glycolysis.

Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\".

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate.

The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil.

The four main ones to be familir with are the freezing point depression, vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values. When you take away solute, the boiling point elevation and osmotic pressure will both decrease. Finally, you have to be familiar with their equations. The equation for freezing point depression is -Kfim (where Kf is a constant for each molecule, i is the Van't Hoff factor, and m is the molality). The equation for boiling point elevation is Kbim (where Kb is the constant for boiling point elevation, i is the Van't Hoff factor, and m is the molality).

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":false,"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"","question":"The conversion of solid to liquid is what?","type":"choices","explanation":"The conversion of gas to a liquid is known as condensation and the conversion of a gas to a solid is known as deposition.

Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\".

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":true,"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"","question":"Galactose is the C-5 epimer of glucose","explanation":"Galactose is the C-4 epimer of glucose.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":"d","choices":{"a":"Shading","b":"Contour","c":"Constancy","d":"All of the above"},"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea"},{"image":"","question":"Which of the following is NOT a form of epigenetic modification?","explanation":"Epigenetics is the study of the changes in DNA that are not caused by DNA sequence changes.

The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate. Finally, this process occurs in places such as the liver, adrenal cortex (as this is where FA synthesis/steroid synthesis occur), erythrocytes, and lactating mammary glands.","trial":false,"answer":true,"subcategory":"e05639d2-da6a-450c-b6c4-d3188fb53300","category":"c711d753-f826-4009-a30a-05aa8e81d51e"},{"image":"P283","question":"The catecholamines are synthesized where?","type":"choices","explanation":"The adrenal medulla is responsible for releasing the catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine) during stress responses.

The four main ones to be familir with are the freezing point depression, vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup. The choroid of the eye is the blood vessels that nourish it and the sclera is the white of the eye that is involved in the overall structure and protection of the eye.","trial":false,"answer":true,"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"P53","question":"Acetyl-CoA is an allosteric inhibitor of glycolysis","type":"bool","explanation":"Glycolysis is the conversion of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","type":"bool","trial":false,"answer":true,"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"","question":"A common physical symptom is muscle tension refers to which disorder?","type":"choices","explanation":"","trial":false,"answer":"a","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","choices":{"a":"General anxiety disorder","b":"Panic disorder","c":"OCD","d":"PTSD"},"subcategory":"1e7bda54-d615-4fc7-8584-5626b3ca0c4b"},{"image":"","question":"The fovea centralis is used when you stare directly at something","explanation":"The fovea centralis is used to help focus the line of sight onto a particular object.

Insomnia is the inability to fall asleep or maintain sleep. Sleep deprivation is where the body is fatigued due to decreased amount of sleep. Sleep apnea is where an individual repeatedly stops and starts breathing and is comorbid with obesity and snoring. The parasomnias include night terrors and somnambulism. Night terrors, which commonly occur in children, are characterized by intense episodes of yelling and intense fear while asleep. This can also be seen in individuals with PTSD.

The conjunctiva is the thin layer of cells that lines the inside of your eyelid. The cornea is the place where light first comes into contact with the eye and it begins to refract or bend the light. The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":true,"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea"},{"image":"P53","question":"How many pyruvate are made per glucose?","type":"choices","explanation":"Glycolysis is the conversion of glucose into pyruvate.

The four main ones to be familir with are the freezing point depression, vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values. When you take away solute, the boiling point elevation and osmotic pressure will both decrease. Finally, you have to be familiar with their equations. The equation for freezing point depression is -Kfim (where Kf is a constant for each molecule, i is the Van't Hoff factor, and m is the molality). The equation for boiling point elevation is Kbim (where Kb is the constant for boiling point elevation, i is the Van't Hoff factor, and m is the molality).

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

The four main ones to be familir with are the freezing point depression, vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values. When you take away solute, the boiling point elevation and osmotic pressure will both decrease. Finally, you have to be familiar with their equations. The equation for freezing point depression is -Kfim (where Kf is a constant for each molecule, i is the Van't Hoff factor, and m is the molality). The equation for boiling point elevation is Kbim (where Kb is the constant for boiling point elevation, i is the Van't Hoff factor, and m is the molality).

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered).

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":"d","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","choices":{"a":"Relative size","b":"Interposition","c":"Relative height","d":"All of the above"}},{"image":"P243","question":"The specific immune system is also called the nonadaptive immune system.","explanation":"There are two divisions to the immune system: the innate and the adaptive.

The four main ones to be familir with are the freezing point depression, vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure. Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

The first twin appears larger because he is closer, but Brian still thinks it is the same size. What describes this?","explanation":"There are visual cues in which humans do not require the use of both eyes and only one. These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","type":"choices","trial":false,"answer":"b","choices":{"a":"Relative size","b":"Size Constancy","c":"Shape Constancy","d":"Color Constancy"},"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"","question":"Glucagon increases glycogen synthesis.","type":"bool","explanation":"Glucagon is a hormone that promotes the release of glucose for the body to use.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

It is important to note that, within organic chemistry, reactivity and stability share an inverse relationship. If our stability increases, this means our reactivity decreased and vice versa.","trial":false,"answer":false,"category":"b25477b7-5bd9-42b9-98f3-3c3bf4b4f494","subcategory":"4a21e8bd-4d1a-483d-924a-295fa86636b2"},{"image":"","question":"Inhibition of PFK-1 by ATP is allosteric feedback.","type":"bool","explanation":"PFK-1 produces ATP through its reaction.

The anterior chamber, which has aqueous humor, is responsible for housing the aqueous humor which helps to maintain the shape of the eye and provide it nutrients. The pupil is the middle portion of the iris that is responsible for allowing light in based on whether the iris is contract or relaxing (contracting= decreased light, relaxing=more light). The iris is the portion that gives the eye color and has the muscle that changes the size of the pupil. The lens is the portion that bends the light and focuses it on the retina (and more specifically, on the fovea). It uses the suspensory ligaments to help with this process.The posterior chamber (behind the iris) also contains aqueous humor and the vitreous chamber contains vitreous humor which helps to provide more pressure for the eye.The retina is the area where there are photoreceptors that convert the light into an electrochemical impulse that the brain can pickup.

The first is that it provides a source for NADPH from G6P. NADPH is involved in reductive reactions such as glutathione reduction inside eryhrocytes, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis (thus, why it is often nicknamed the \"anabolic cofactor\" while NADH is the \"catabolic cofactor). This pathway has the ability to go through two phases: an oxidative (irreversible phase) and a nonoxidative phase (irreversible phase). The oxidative phase has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the rate limiting enzyme of the PPP and this converts G6P into 6-phosphogluconate. The oxidative phase can yield ribulose-5-phosphate, which can go into nucleotide synthesis as ribose-5-phosphate. The nonoxidative phase in made up of transketolases that can be converted to many different glycolytic intermediates. There is no ATP that is used or created during this process. Furthermore, the oxidative phase produces 2 NADPH for every one glucose-6-phosphate molecule.  Thiamine pyrophosphate is one of the cofactors that is required for the nonoxidative phase (transketolases). The products for the oxidative phase are CO2, 2 NADPH, and ribulose-5-phosphate while the products for the nonoxidative phase are ribose-5-phosphate, glycerladehyde-3-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate.

The SN1 reaction is based on a two-step process that utilizes the leaving group as its first step and then the attack of the nucleophile as its second. It will replace the original leaving group on the substrate with a new nucleophile. It is favored by polar protic solvents (such as water or ethanol), its reaction rate is only dependent upon the leaving group/substrate, it yields a racemic mixture (enantiomers of one another) and a strong nucleophile is not required. the SN2 reaction has the same outcome: the nucleophile replaces the leaving group on the substrate. However, the main difference is that this occurs in a concerted mechanism, or in one step.SN2 reactions favor methyl substrates, favor polar aprotic solvents, are optically active (resulting in an inversion of configuration), and are favored with a stronger nucleophile (something with a negative charge).","type":"choices","answer":"b","choices":{"a":"1","b":"2","c":"3","d":"4"},"category":"b25477b7-5bd9-42b9-98f3-3c3bf4b4f494","subcategory":"c1e401a6-3592-4674-bf04-301b242e837e"},{"image":"","question":"A linear electronic geometry has a bond angle of 120.","type":"bool","explanation":"Electron geometries can be separated into multiple types and are based on the total number of electron pairs, number of lone pairs, and the number of bonding pairs.

Dopamine is the pleasure hormone that also has functionalities in controlling smooth movement and decreasing rigidity in the body (deficiency leads to tremors as seen in Parkinson's). Serotonin is involved in the mood and arousal of the body, as well as certain portions of the  REM sleep cycle. GABA and glycine are both inhibitory neurotransmitters that are involved in hyperpolarization of the cell and cause an inhibiton effect within the brain.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","type":"bool","trial":false,"answer":true,"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"","question":"Tautomers are what type of isomer?","type":"choices","explanation":"Constitutional isomers are those that have the same molecular formula but are connected in different ways.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":false,"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"","question":"Electrons in the excited state can return to a lower energy state.","explanation":"Whenever electrons are absorbed, there will be a net positive energy change (think of the mnemonic AHED).

After this, ovulation will occur (generally around day 14) and this is triggered by the LH surge. This will cause the most mature follicle to be spit out (which is based on how many LH receptors are located on it) and this cell is also known as the secondary oocyte.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered).

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","type":"bool","trial":false,"answer":true,"category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5","subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea"},{"image":"","question":"A nitrile can be reacted with acid to produce a carboxylic acid.","type":"bool","explanation":"There are many different reactions, specifically those related to the carboxylic acid derivatives, that you need to be familiar with.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).","trial":false,"answer":false,"subcategory":"079093ec-a699-4e31-890f-75e440423fea","category":"b6274519-21a0-432a-82f0-7a998e33baa5"},{"image":"","question":"Water is considered a polar protic solvent.","type":"bool","explanation":"Specificity within organic chemistry is a very important topic, especially when it comes to substitution and elimination reactions.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

Which of the following describes this?","type":"choices","explanation":"There are visual cues in which humans do not require the use of both eyes and only one. These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered).

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as \"the velocity is constant\" or \"the velocity is zero\". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity.

These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered).

Furthermore, you have to be familiar with what happens when you add a solute (or take it away) and how that impacts each of the colligative properties. When you add a solute, both the freezing point depression and the vapor pressure will decrease and when you take away a solute both will increase. Freezing point decreases because the equation contains a negative sign (thus, a larger negative value is formed) while, in vapor pressure, adding a solute will ultimately increase the strength of the intermolecular forces contained in solution and wll thus increase the temperature that is needed to boil (high vapor pressures are correlated with things that are easier to boil). When you add solute, both the boiling point elevation and the osmotic pressure of the solution will increase. This is because of the their formulas are positive in nature, and increasing the molality (in boiling point elevaton) or increasing the molarity (in osmotic pressure) will ultimately increase the value in the equation, thus leading to higher values.

NADPH, on the other hand, is involved in fatty acid synthesis, nucleotide synthesis, cholesterol synthesis, and the reduction of reactive oxygen species. In general, you want to think of the two like this: NADH is involved in catabolic processes (breaking things down; glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, etc.) and NADPH is involved in anabolic processes (building things up; fatty acid synthesis, cholesterol synthesis, nucleotide synthesis).","trial":false,"answer":false,"category":"c711d753-f826-4009-a30a-05aa8e81d51e","subcategory":"e05639d2-da6a-450c-b6c4-d3188fb53300"},{"image":"","question":"Candace is a student trying to run an organic chemistry reaction in lab. Her goal is to achieve an SN2 reaction with a strong nucleophile. Which of the following could be used?","explanation":"Specificity within organic chemistry is a very important topic, especially when it comes to the substitution and elimination reactions. One way to choose a pathway is be selecting the nucleophile to favor a particular way. SN2 reactions are favored by strong nucleophiles, polar aprotic solvents, and methyl or primary substrates. Examples of strong nucleophiles are: the halogens (I-, Br-, and Cl-) excluding F-, HO-, HS-, H2S, RO-, RSH, and nitriles. The odd ones of these listed are fluorine (as it is a halogen) and RSH/H2S (no negative charge). Fluorine is not considered a strong leaving group because of its high electronegativity, making it incredibly stable on its own compared to the others. H2S and RSH are both strong nucleophiles because of the size of the sulfur atoms compared to oxygen (sulfur is a better nucleophile when compared to analagous oxygen compounds). SN1 reactions are favored by weaker nucleophiles, polar protic solvents, and tertiary substrates. Examples of weak nucleophiles are F- (as discussed previously), H2O (no negative charge, stable on its own), and ROH (similar to H2O).","type":"choices","answer":"d","subcategory":"c1e401a6-3592-4674-bf04-301b242e837e","category":"b25477b7-5bd9-42b9-98f3-3c3bf4b4f494","choices":{"a":"I-","b":"Cl-","c":"Nitrile (with a negative charge)","d":"All of the above"}},{"image":"","question":"A death in the family is considered a catastrophic event.","type":"bool","explanation":"Daily hassle stressors are considered things like traffic jams or a small dispute at work.
